# Linear Regression Project

This project implements a simple linear regression to predict house prices based on their surface area. We use the `pandas` library for data manipulation, `matplotlib` for visualization, and `scikit-learn` for modeling.

## Files

- `prix_maisons.csv`: CSV file containing the surface area and price data of houses.
- `main.py`: Main script containing the linear regression code.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have installed the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn numpy
```
